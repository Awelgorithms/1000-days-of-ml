## Day 4
Back to tic-tac-toe learning, wanted to build a tic tac toe game with minimax algorithm and have 2 AI players play against each other. But this seems to be a solved puzzle, so the game will always tie if AI played against each other. This is still a fun project idea to implement and watch them play though. 

## Day 3 
Tried creating a tic-tac-toe game on python, realised it's difficult as it's more of a UI based game, building the game grid etc was tricky. It's possible, but I realized it would have been way easier and friendlier if this was a js game on the browser. Didn't make much progress in terms of python code, but it was a good exercise.

Need to implement this as a web based game with mini-max algorithm.


## Day 2
Kaggle - Did a Intro to Machine Learning course and learned some pytorch stuff on Kaggle - predicting price of houses etc on a sample data set
It was straight-forward but it wasn't really helping me learn anything significant as most of the coding was high level function calling stuff, didn't get much satisfaction of learning, although I was able to understand at a high level of how the libraries help us train our own models. I realized I need to stop chasing satisfaction and enjoy the process of learning. Need to get back to undercutting and overcutting exercise, that's where I left the course at.

Tried a few lessons andrewng's course on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction as I wanted to learn the underlying concepts of AI and ML. It was a primer course on concepts of ML. I was able to partially complete week 1 as a free course, planning on getting back soon.

## Day 1
Absolute basics, tried out the Freecodecamp's YouTube tutorial on how to make Snake AI learning game

I followed the video and wrote the code along, I didn't understand anything that I wrote but I did manage to make the game run, it crashed for some reason after a few tries. But it was a good win for a project that I was able to follow along in 2-3 hours to understand the process of building a machine learning model and training it.
