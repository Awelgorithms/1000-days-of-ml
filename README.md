## Day 4

Started the day with stumbling over Google's article that got suggested to me on the newsfeed with this link https://www.classcentral.com/subject/ai
which made me go to and sign up on https://course.elementsofai.com/ , made good progress to a point where it spoke about tic-tac-toe, which made me curious about tictactoe minimax algo which made me google some more so I found Kiffman's minimax video on tic tac toe - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ
A lot of great insights

Learning Kiffman's Intro to AI-ML playlist on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y

## Day 3 
Tried creating a tic-tac-toe game on python, realised it's difficult as it's more of a UI based game, building the game grid etc was tricky. It's possible, but I realized it would have been way easier and friendlier if this was a js game on the browser. Didn't make much progress in terms of python code, but it was a good exercise.

Need to implement this as a web based game with mini-max algorithm.


## Day 2
Kaggle - Did a Intro to Machine Learning course and learned some pytorch stuff on Kaggle - predicting price of houses etc on a sample data set
It was straight-forward but it wasn't really helping me learn anything significant as most of the coding was high level function calling stuff, didn't get much satisfaction of learning, although I was able to understand at a high level of how the libraries help us train our own models. I realized I need to stop chasing satisfaction and enjoy the process of learning. Need to get back to undercutting and overcutting exercise, that's where I left the course at.

Tried a few lessons andrewng's course on Coursera https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction as I wanted to learn the underlying concepts of AI and ML. It was a primer course on concepts of ML. I was able to partially complete week 1 as a free course, planning on getting back soon.

## Day 1
Absolute basics, tried out the Freecodecamp's YouTube tutorial on how to make Snake AI learning game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds

I followed the video and wrote the code along, I didn't understand anything that I wrote but I did manage to make the game run, it crashed for some reason after a few tries. But it was a good win for a project that I was able to follow along in 2-3 hours to understand the process of building a machine learning model and training it.
